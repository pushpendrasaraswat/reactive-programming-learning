         * A task that returns a result and may throw an exception. Implementors define a single method with no arguments called call.
         *
         * The Callable interface is similar to Runnable, in that both are designed for classes whose instances are potentially executed by another thread.
         *
         * Supplier:
         *
         *  public interface Supplier<T> {
         *               T get();
         *           }
         * Represents a supplier of results.
         *
         * There is no requirement that a new or distinct result be returned each time the supplier is invoked.
